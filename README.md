## Facial landmarks detection

Detection of facial landmarks using python and opencv.

Facial landmarks are used to localize and represent salient regions of the face, such as:  
 -Eyes   
 -Eyebrows  
 -Nose  
 -Mouth  
 -Jawline  

The pre-trained facial landmark detector inside the dlib library is used to estimate the location of 68 (x, y)-coordinates that map to facial structures on the face.
